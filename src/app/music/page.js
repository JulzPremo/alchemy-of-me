        <h2>Lyrics ‚Äì <em>Playing Possum</em></h2>
        <pre className="lyrics-text">
Rain hits the pavement, heartbeat slow,{"\n"}
I‚Äôve been running from shadows I used to know.{"\n"}
Grandpa‚Äôs hands held me through thick and thin,{"\n"}
But the music kept calling, pulling me back in.{"\n\n"}

Feet on the floor, hear the rhythm ignite,{"\n"}
Every note in my soul, every spark in the night.{"\n"}
From the echoes of pain to the songs of release,{"\n"}
I found my voice, now I'm moving with ease.{"\n\n"}

I‚Äôm never gonna stop this beat,{"\n"}
From the soul to the sky, I feel complete.{"\n"}
Through the highs, through the lows, let the music flow,{"\n"}
I‚Äôm alive, I‚Äôm free, let the whole world know.{"\n\n"}

Every tear, every fall, every midnight call,{"\n"}
Built me up, made me strong‚Äînow I'm standing tall.{"\n"}
With my roots in the earth and my heart in the sky,{"\n"}
I‚Äôm dancing through the storm with my head held high.{"\n\n"}

I‚Äôm never gonna stop this beat,{"\n"}
From the soul to the sky, I feel complete.{"\n"}
Let the drums kick in, let the bass line roll,{"\n"}
I‚Äôm alive, I‚Äôm free, and I‚Äôm in control.

        <h2>üíª Composing with Code: Sonic Pi</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Playing Possum</em> is not just a lyrical piece‚Äîit's a coding journey. Using <strong>Sonic Pi</strong>, I‚Äôve been programming the backtrack from the ground up with Ruby-based code, crafting beats, melodies, and ambient effects to match the mood and story of the lyrics.
        </p>
        <ul className="project-points">
          <li><strong>Beat & Rhythm:</strong> Custom drum loops coded in a steady 80 BPM using <code>live_loop</code> for modular timing</li>
          <li><strong>Ambient Texture:</strong> Vinyl crackle and tape hiss layered via sample effects to evoke nostalgia and emotional grounding</li>
          <li><strong>Melodic Structure:</strong> Lead melody composed using <code>play_pattern_timed</code> with reverb and echo FX</li>
          <li><strong>Dynamic Build:</strong> Chorus-driven energy shifts achieved with volume fades, stacked harmonics, and tempo consistency</li>
          <li><strong>Code Highlights:</strong> Thread management for live loops, sound layering, and synchronized cueing for section transitions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This coding-first approach allows for total control over the emotional arc of the song‚Äîblending structured logic with intuitive musicality.
          The final mix will be exported for audio embedding and later vocal layering in GarageBand or another DAW.
