          <pre className="lyrics-text">
Rain hits the pavement, heartbeat slow,{"\n"}
I‚Äôve been running from shadows I used to know.{"\n"}
Grandpa‚Äôs hands held me through thick and thin,{"\n"}
But the music kept calling, pulling me back in.{"\n\n"}
Feet on the floor, hear the rhythm ignite,{"\n"}
Every note in my soul, every spark in the night.{"\n"}
From the echoes of pain to the songs of release,{"\n"}
I found my voice, now I'm moving with ease.{"\n\n"}
I‚Äôm never gonna stop this beat,{"\n"}
From the soul to the sky, I feel complete.{"\n"}
Through the highs, through the lows, let the music flow,{"\n"}
I‚Äôm alive, I‚Äôm free, let the whole world know.{"\n\n"}
Every tear, every fall, every midnight call,{"\n"}
Built me up, made me strong‚Äînow I'm standing tall.{"\n"}
With my roots in the earth and my heart in the sky,{"\n"}
I‚Äôm dancing through the storm with my head held high.{"\n\n"}
I‚Äôm never gonna stop this beat,{"\n"}
From the soul to the sky, I feel complete.{"\n"}
Let the drums kick in, let the bass line roll,{"\n"}
I‚Äôm alive, I‚Äôm free, and I‚Äôm in control.

          <p>
            This is my first time creating music using Sonic Pi, and I brought the layers together in Audacity to shape the early foundation of this track.
            It‚Äôs not fully complete yet‚ÄîI still want to refine the timing and add more depth‚Äîbut I‚Äôm proud of how far it‚Äôs come.
            It‚Äôs already capturing the emotion, code, and courage I set out to express.

          <h2 className="section-title">üé≠ The Story Behind <em>Playing Possum</em></h2>
          <p>
            <em>Playing Possum</em> was born from a deeply personal place‚Äîwhere fear meets performance, and survival becomes an art.
            The phrase itself captures what I‚Äôve often felt: playing dead to stay safe, quieting my truth to keep the peace.
            But behind that stillness lived a soul aching to dance, sing, and scream her story.
          </p>
          <p>
            This song explores the tension between my inner light and shadow, especially as someone navigating mental health, trauma recovery, and personal identity.
            It‚Äôs about the masks we wear, the parts we silence, and what it means to finally reclaim your voice...
          </p>
          <p>
            I built the instrumental layers using Sonic Pi, experimenting with rhythm coding, ambient textures, and gradual build-ups.
            The song fuses electronic elements with organic emotion‚Äîmirroring my journey of using tech and art to reconnect with myself.
